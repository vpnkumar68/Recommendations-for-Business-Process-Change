# Recommendations-for-Business-Process-Change
* Proposed a data-driven business process change proposal about how to increase the numbers of tests that users complete.
* Worked on real world data of Dognition company and made visualizations & business data stories with the help of Tableau.
* [My Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vipin1972#!/vizhome/Story1_15945459905010/Story1?publish=yes)
* I have proposed the following recommendations after analysis of Dognition data â€“
1. Implement Achievement such as badges to keep subscribers engaged and get feedback from Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most most and provide better training videos of game if needed. 
2. Implement targeted communication such as reminder emails and notifications around 7 PM on certain weekdays (that are Saturday, Sunday and Monday) as an incentive to play
3. Advertise to Countries where potential customers could arise. Set up a point program that accumulate as user complete tests and assessments to later gift coupons that can be claimed from pet retailer like Petco.
