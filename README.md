# Recommendations-for-Business-Process-Change
* Proposed a data-driven business process change proposal about how to increase the numbers of tests that users complete.
* Worked on real world data of Dognition company and made visualizations & business data stories with the help of Tableau.
* [My Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vipin1972#!/vizhome/Story1_15945459905010/Story1?publish=yes)
* Dognition have varying degree of user participation levels and there is a consistent trend of drop off test rates. My SMART Goal is to improve the completion rate of the first 20 test completed per subscriber by 10% over the next 3 months.
* I have proposed the following recommendations after analysis of Dognition data â€“
1. Implement Achievement such as badges to keep subscribers engaged and get feedback from Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most most and provide better training videos of game if needed. 
2. Implement targeted communication such as reminder emails and notifications around 7 PM on certain weekdays (that are Saturday, Sunday and Monday) as an incentive to play
3. Advertise to Countries where potential customers could arise. Set up a point program that accumulate as user complete tests and assessments to later gift coupons that can be claimed from pet retailer like Petco.
